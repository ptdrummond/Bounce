# Bounce
A traversal-platform game that uses basic physics and environmental variables as obstacles to the player.

# NOTE: THIS GAME REQUIRES THE PYGAME LIBRARY INSTALLED IN PYTHON 3.6+ TO WORK PROPERLY

The player controls the green square, attempting to jump from platform to platform to reach a gold square.

Reaching the gold square advances 1 level (+100 pts).

Falling off into the void below: -10 pts.

Red platforms are solid, stationary, and can be landed/walked on!

Blue blocks bounce the player upwards and can move.
